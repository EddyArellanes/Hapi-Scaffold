#FullStack Application
`If you don't want to build an web application with Angular,React or Vue, you can do that in the classic mode like Php. To do this you need to use this Modules:`
- npm install handlebars
- npm install vision

- Handlebards allows you to render dynamic data in Html files
- Vision is a Hapi's Plugin for create template responses

`I have insert an example called server-handlebars, if you want to know how it works`
`However I prefer to use Node as Backend only and delegate UI to Frontend Framework... use Vue :3`
